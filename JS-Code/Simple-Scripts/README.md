#What should you expect here?

First off, HI!! I am running low on juice and a little high and also managed to default to auto pilot mode. Hoping that is enough excuse to get off of my case on the supposedly missing sanity of mine. -_-

Here is a compilation of all my works on JS when I was playing around with my blog (during my exams not the finals though I was doing a website at that time ... *awkward chuckle* ) in the month of May-June.

Some of the working examples can be found [here](https://hithertodauntless.blogspot.in/search/label/JavaScript) --> Heavy Page load though so ming you you have been warned or something along those lines ^_^
